In the previous chapter we described what effects is resulted by Pa variation.

But what will happen if we change Pa and Ca at the same time.

Consider two dimensional Ca-Pa variations of the Round Parameters. These parameters were selected, because Ca and Pa give largest input to the diamond optics.

The diagrams show ASET and Office images.
Violet square highlights Tolkowsky proportions. The borders of the GIA EX area are shown in gray.
#### Ca and Pa variation

* — Ca-Pa variation
* — Table 57%
* — Star 50%
* — LGF length 80%

#### Pa variation with Fixed Ca

We already decreased and increased the Pavilion Angle while other fixed parameters. It caused significant ray path change in diamond. So the optical characteristic of diamond changes too.

For example, we modify Pavilion angle from 40.8 for Tolkowsky to 41.4 degrees with other parameters fixed.

It can be seen that the diamond with Pa 41.4 is very different from Tolkowsky both in the ASET image and Office (note the partial leakage under the table).

#### Pa variation compensation using Ca

But deeper Pavilion can be compensated by Crown angle decrease.

In this case, we can reduce Ca from 34.5 to 31.5 to compensate deep Pavilion.

The resulting proportions of Ca 31.5 Pa 41.4 will be optically close to Tolkowsky, but will have different Ca-Pa parameters.

#### Sweet Line

The combination of Ca-Pa proportions, which give a round diamond optics similar to the reference (Tolkowsky) is called Sweet line.

Diamond proportions positioned on Sweet line can be produced to increase yield and at the same time maintain optical performance.

#### Anti Sweet Line

The reverse line to Sweet line is called Anti Sweet (Bitter) line. Movement along it leads to a significant change in the optics of the diamond.

#### Vertical variation

Let's consider the results of vertical deviation from the reference.
For Pa 40.2, we get the Head Obscuration area, in which the arrows of the diamond remain always dark during human observation. This is an example of stones where blue in ASET gives a negative contribution to Brilliance by creating constantly black Dead Zones (Dear Arrows) in stone.

The proportions of Pa 41.4 have a partial leakage under the Crown, which we spoke about earlier. The partial leakage area creates both white and black zones during human observation.

Generally Ca-Pa chart can be divided into 3 main areas:
* — area of ​​good proportions optically close to the reference (Sweet line area)
* — area of ​​Dead Zones associated with Head Obscuration (area above Sweet Line)
* — partial Table Leakage area (area below Sweet Line)

**Obviously,** we’ve styled up *all the basic* text formatting options [available in markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

You can create lists:

* Simple bulleted lists
* Like this one
* Are cool

And:

1. Numbered lists
2. Like this other one
3. Are great too

You can also add blockquotes, which are shown at a larger width to help break up the layout and draw attention to key parts of your content:

> “Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.”

The theme also supports markdown tables:

| Item                 | Author        | Supports tables? | Price |
|----------------------|---------------|------------------|-------|
| Duet Jekyll Theme    | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $49   |
| Index Jekyll Theme   | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $49   |
| Journal Jekyll Theme | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $49   |

And footnotes[^1], which link to explanations[^2] at the bottom of the page[^3].

[^1]: Beautiful modern, minimal theme design.
[^2]: Powerful features to show off your work.
[^3]: Maintained and supported by the theme developer.

You can throw in some horizontal rules too:

#### Image galleries

Here's a really neat custom feature we added – galleries:

{% include post-components/gallery.html
	columns = 2
	full_width = true
	images = "/images/demo.jpg,/images/demo.jpg,/images/demo.jpg,/images/demo.jpg,
	"
%}

Inspired by the Galleries feature from WordPress, we've made it easy to create grid layouts for your images. Just use a simple Liquid snippet in your post to create a masonry grid image layout:

{% raw %}
```liquid
{% include post-components/gallery.html
	columns = 2
	full_width = true
	images = "/images/demo.jpg,/images/demo.jpg,/images/demo.jpg,/images/demo.jpg,
	"
%}
```
{% endraw %}

*See what we did there? Code and syntax highlighting is built-in too!*

Change the number inside the 'columns' setting to create different types of gallery for all kinds of purposes. You can even click on each image to seamlessly enlarge it on the page.


#### Image carousels

Here's another gallery with only one column, which creates a carousel slide-show instead.

A nice little feature: the carousel only advances when it is in view, so your visitors won't scroll down to find it half way through your images.

{% include post-components/gallery.html
	columns = 1
	full_width = true
	images = "/images/demo.jpg,/images/demo.jpg,/images/demo.jpg
	"
%}

#### What about videos?

Videos are an awesome way to show off your work in a more engaging and personal way, and we’ve made sure they work great on our themes. Just paste an embed code from YouTube or Vimeo, and the theme makes sure it displays perfectly:

{% include post-components/video.html
	url = "https://player.vimeo.com/video/270725085?color=6c6e95&title=0&byline=0"
	full_width = true
%}

### Pretty cool, huh?

We've packed this theme with powerful features to show off your work.
Why not put them to use on your new website?
