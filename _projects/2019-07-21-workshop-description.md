Communication in a diamond shop may start with a dynamic chart, similar to the one presented here. Consumer sees that diamond can be beautiful in different ways and can make different types of impressions.
Salesperson clarifies the role of the lighting and follows the consumer's preferred left- or right- brain side language to select the most personality-matching diamond option.

**Why the technologies and the course are needed**
_There are unaddressed opportunities in the diamond market. New technologies withdraw the existing obstacles._

1. Diamond sales stagnate in developed markets. Diamonds become less and less attractive in new generations. Repeat purchases are jeopardized by absence of high-performing product diversity and novelty.
2. Even at the growing markets diamond appearance and beauty are not effectively promoted to consumers; current communications are lab-report-numbers-based and refer to the left side of the brain predominantly, so emotional bonding with product is quite limited. This makes diamonds uncompetitive vs other luxury goods in a long-term. This is a crucial gap especially because research reports more and more women are becoming decision makers in diamond purchases and women are more image- and emotion- driven  than men.
3. Currently salesperson is not able to demonstrate diamond beauty to consumer in 5-10 minutes. It is not easy to justify difference in diamonds' performance either. Now this takes a lot of time and requires high qualification of sales personnel because diamond is very small and consumer typically can not spot fine details (D/IF, H&A, for example). Thus, currently it is salesperson who makes the choice and convinces client. This often results in unconfidence, mistrust and lack of emotional bonding with diamond.
4. Most of the resources that the diamond industry invests are used for making a first sale (usually an engagement diamond), which is a very inefficient business model. There is no general know-how to increase the repeating purchases which is the most lucrative approach.
5. There are consumers who are interested in more than one diamond but there is no alluring offerings, just bigger round stones.
6. The efficient market growth and highest return on promotion investments will be reached when the ratio of second (and all subsequent) purchases to first-time purchase increases.

**What addresses the diamond market opportunities**
_There is a spectrum of means to combine targeting the opportunities._

It is necessary to help customers to enjoy the first purchase experience and product so much that they will be interested to return for a second/next diamond. It will be possible **if the product and the selection process are intriguing, pleasant and novel**:

* big scale videos and pictures clearly demonstrating diamonds' actual appearance and beauty;
* combination of two talks for left and right sides of the brain: optical performance numbers and diamond impression;
* virtual availability of different great cuts at every price level plus master stone sets for testimonials;
* match of customer personality and key emotional needs with product;
* fun and interesting experience;
* cool to share with social group far beyond the 4c's: emotions and uniqueness of appearance.

Triggers for second/next diamond purchase can be the same that other luxury groups are using:

* New sensory stimuli - **New diamond experience** (new cuts with different Fire/Brilliance combinations, patterns, etc.).
* Fashion - **Diamond Seasonal Upgrades** (like fashion in designer clothes, bags, etc.).
* **Diamonds for different consumption occasions**. There are most suitable cuts for different wearing occasions: for parties, in office, etc. where every cut delivers the best of its performance. A second/next diamond has to be the best option for a second/next wearing occasion.
* **Collectable Diamonds** (there is no one best/ideal diamond with "best" combination of Fire/Brilliance/Scintillation/Color. This is the reason to collect different beautiful diamonds: Max Fire, Max Brilliance, etc. One diamond is not unique, a collection of specially selected diamonds can be unique highlighting an owner's personality. There could be jewelry made of a special collection of diamonds.

**How to incorporate in everyday**

There are new tools that can be used by a salesperson to support trustfull communication with consumers. This results in an informed, stressless and enjoyable client's choice by comparing details of Optical Performance and impression of different diamonds.

**Digital stage**

<ul type="disc" class="custom-full-program-padding">
  <li><b>DiBox2 movies and optical performance data - a first aid in selection</b></li>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>Twofold presentation of diamond matches all possible types of personal perception: optical performance data address left side of the brain while and actual appearance/impression demonstrated on a big screen communicates with right side. For a newbie client it is much easier to choose first diamond by examining images made with a "digital loope" and supported by optical performance rates. Salesperson helps to spot details but their subjective importance is decided by client.</li>
    <li>Clients can compare in a natural way images of several diamonds or performance ranks, including master stones, because all films are recorded in standard lighting conditions.This allows consumers to make their own informed comparison and select the most appealing stones.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Interactive selection tool</b> - a communication tool which uses DiBox2 movies. Computer aided sequence of diamond demonstrations, which simplifies and speeds up the selection process. Salesperson supports the process but the final selection is made by client.</li>
</ul>

**Real life stage**
<ul type="disc" class="custom-full-program-padding">
  <li><b>DiBox JD - real life diamond demonstration and comparison device.</b> It lets clients to verify their "digital" choice by comparing real diamonds from shortlist made while checking enlarged images. Comparison of pairs and examination of every preselected stone help to see the details and differences that consumer spotted in digital images.</li>
</ul>

**Conduct of the course**

The course is a balanced combination of lectures and practical sessions. It is divided into 3 parts that make learning effective and consistent:

<ol class="custom-full-program-padding">
  <li>The introductory part provides the theoretical explanation on Diamond Beauty basics,  Performance Custom Grading and two types of the language for left and right sides of the brain.</li>
  <li>During the second part of the course the DiBox JD will be introduced together with an exclusive selection of differently shaped polished diamonds of record optical performance. Observation with the DiBox JD easily reveals how perceived diamond beauty varies depending on consumption and diamond details, like:</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>lighting settings (office, disco, outdoor lighting conditions);</li>
    <li>distance from diamond to observer;</li>
    <li>diamond size;</li>
    <li>diamond surface cleanliness.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>At the third part of the course you will practice a professional talk on Diamond Beauty using diamond collections on a smartphone or PC.</li>
</ol>

**Practical takeaways**
